(Troy Seals - Donnie Fritts)

Down the dusty Dixie road
My old Levi's draggin' tracks
Nobody cares about where I'm going
They all know I'm coming back.

Wish I had me a true fine woman
Let her rock me all night long
Baby we could get it together
Like people do in them old love songs.

I can hear somebody laughin'
Funny how it makes me sad
Lord I wish it was Sunday morning
Saturday night sure looking bad.

Wish I had me a true fine woman
Let her rock me all night long
Baby we could get it together
Like people do in them old love songs.

I wish I had me a true fine woman
Let her rock me all night long
Baby we could get it together
Like people do in them old love songs.

Yeah baby, we could get it together
Like people do in them old love songs...
