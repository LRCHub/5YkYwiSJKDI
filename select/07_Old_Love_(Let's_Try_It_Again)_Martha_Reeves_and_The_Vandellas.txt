You old love
Why did I have to see you again?
When we parted
We said we'd be no more than friends

But when I saw your face
I wished that we could erase
The past and start a love
That would surely last

Old love
I was once blind now I see
That no other love
Could ever be for me
But this funny feeling
I feel inside makes me wish
And vow to never ever be untrue

You old love
Why did I have to see you again?
When we parted
We said we'd be no more than friends

Old love
I know I made a big mistake
If you give me another chance
I'll try and erase
All the pain I caused you
All the hurt I did you so
Old love
Come on let's try it again
Old love
Come on let's try it again
Come on love yeah
One more time
One more time
Say you'll be mine.
